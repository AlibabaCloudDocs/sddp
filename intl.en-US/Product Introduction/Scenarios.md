# Scenarios

Sensitive Data Discovery and Protection \(SDDP\) classifies and de-identifies sensitive data to help you precisely detect and protect sensitive data.

## Detect sensitive data and mark it with risk levels

SDDP can detect sensitive data in a large amount of data and accurately distinguish sensitive data from non-sensitive data. SDDP scans your structured and unstructured data assets for sensitive data based on the built-in algorithms and custom sensitive data detection rules. SDDP classifies the sensitive data that is detected and marks it with risk levels for further protection, such as fine-grained access control and storage encryption.

## Detect data leaks to protect data

SDDP uses an intelligent detection model to analyze access of Alibaba Cloud accounts or external users to sensitive data. If anomalous access is detected, SDDP sends alerts to your data security team.

## De-identify sensitive data

SDDP supports built-in and custom de-identification algorithms. You can use these algorithms to de-identify sensitive data that is obtained from the production environment before you transfer the sensitive data to other environments such as the development or test environment. SDDP ensures that the de-identified sensitive data is usable in other environments.

## Comply with the requirements on personal information protection

SDDP can accurately distinguish personal data from other data and protect personal data to prevent compliance issues.

## Meet GDPR requirements

SDDP can detect sensitive data in a large amount of data and allows you to audit the use of sensitive data. This allows you to meet the General Data Protection Regulation \(GDPR\) requirements for sensitive data protection.

## Check data security compliance

In response to the requirements of relevant supervision departments for checking data security compliance, SDDP provides features regarding data security to help you achieve data security compliance. The features include sensitive data classification, data leak detection, and data de-identification.

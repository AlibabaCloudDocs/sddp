# Benefits

Sensitive Data Discovery and Protection \(SDDP\) can scan a large amount of data for sensitive data to help you obtain the security status of your data assets in real time.

## Compliant

SDDP helps you meet compliance requirements on **personal information protection** and **security audit in cloud computing**, as specified in Baseline for Classified Protection of Cybersecurity 2.0.

## Cloud-native

SDDP fully leverages its advantages as a cloud-native service and integrates with a variety of data assets on the cloud to provide integrated data protection and defense services. SDDP supports the most common cloud data storage services for both structured and unstructured data, such as Object Storage Service \(OSS\), ApsaraDB RDS, DRDS, PolarDB, Tablestore, MaxCompute, and self-managed databases hosted on Elastic Compute Service \(ECS\).

## Intelligent

SDDP uses big data technologies, machine learning, and intelligent algorithms to detect and monitor sensitive data, high-risk activities such as anomalous data access, and potential data leaks. In addition, SDDP provides suggestions to how to resolve detected issues.

## Visualized

SDDP visualizes the results of sensitive data detection. This allows an enterprise to obtain a clear view of the security status of its data assets. SDDP allows you to dynamically display and query data assets in a visualized way. You can find sensitive data in a large amount of data with a few clicks.

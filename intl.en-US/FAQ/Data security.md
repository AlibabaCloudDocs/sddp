# Data security

This topic provides answers to commonly asked questions about data security in Sensitive Data Discovery and Protection \(SDDP\).

## Does SDDP store my data?

Sensitive Data Discovery and Protection \(SDDP\) does not store your data. After you authorize SDDP to access data assets, SDDP scans data in the data assets. Then, SDDP displays the scan results in the SDDP console for your use.

## How can I audit the operations that are related to SDDP?

SDDP records all operations in ActionTrail by using the ActionTrail API.

SDDP is integrated with ActionTrail. After you activate ActionTrail, you can view all the operations that are related to SDDP and review their security in ActionTrail. For more information about how to activate ActionTrail, see [Billing](/intl.en-US/Pricing/Billing.md).
